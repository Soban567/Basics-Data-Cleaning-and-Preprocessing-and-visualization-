This project focuses on preparing raw datasets for analysis by performing essential data cleaning, feature preprocessing, and exploratory data visualization.
It includes:

Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and fixing inconsistencies.

Preprocessing â€“ Normalization, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

Visualization â€“ Using charts and plots to understand trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (or Plotly)
